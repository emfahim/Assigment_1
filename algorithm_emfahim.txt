Algorithm for Assignment 1 - first iteration - By Esrak Fahim
[Note: Do not submit this as your own for Checkpoint 1]

(1) I use def leap_yeear(obj). It will take a year in 4-digit 'YYYY' format.
    It will return True if given year is a leap year

(2) The sanitize(obj1, obj2) function will take two string objects
    The first string object is the object to be sanitized,
    and the 2nd string object contains characters that are allowed.

(3) The size_check(obj, introbj) function will take a collection data type
    object and the expected number of items as an integer in this order and
    it will return 'True' or 'False' after it is called.

(4) The range_check(obj2, obj2) function will take an integer
    object (e.g. year) and a tuple with 2 integer values respectively.
    Regarding tuples, the first value indicates the lower bound and
    the second one indicates the upper bound of an integer range.

(5) The usage() function will be called (and displayed to the standard input)
    when the command line arguments are not equal to 2.

(6) I use the (if __name__ == "__main__":) part from the assignmnet instraction and for the final part.
